In the same way that it is possible to set the width of the output, the indent of the first
line can be controlled independently of subsequent lines.

1.2.7 Truncating Long Text
To truncate text to create a summary or preview, use shorten(). All existing whitespace, such as tabs,
newlines, and series of multiple spaces, will be standardized to a single space. Then the text will be
truncated to a length less than or equal to what is requested, between word boundaries so that no partial
words are included.
